# Keys2Text Proxy

Keys2Text Proxy is a Python-based application that acts as an **API proxy server**, 
offering **OpenAI API compatibility** while seamlessly routing requests to multiple 
AI providers using your own API keys. You can use the familiar OpenAI endpoints in your 
existing code and effortlessly switch between providers—Anthropic, Google AI Studio, Groq, 
OpenRouter, DeepSeek, LM Studio, Ollama, or OpenAI itself—**simply by configuring your API keys**.
